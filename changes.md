## THING TO CHECK
- remove all perror and errno
## DONE
- redir + body hangs
- Test Cockies And CGI
- look for the HTTP response status codes list on internet and during this evaluation
- if method is not post/delete/get 
- config root end py '/' & nessacery a dir
- add Redrection to post after read all body
- if location '/' is the first it uses it
- Leaks
- delete does delete a file with no permission
- add / to end of public in the case is not found
